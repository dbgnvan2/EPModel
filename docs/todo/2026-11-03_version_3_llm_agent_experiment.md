# Version 3, part 2 — the LLM-agent experiment, 2026-11-03

Items from planning the LLM-agent experiment (`docs/plan_v3_llm_agent_experiment.md`), the second of the two new
utilities the owner decided version 3 has (2026-11-03).

- [ ] T-183 ⟨later⟩ **The LLM-agent experiment: build the approved plan (2026-11-03; approved 2026-11-06).** The
  plan's seven decisions (§9, Q1–Q7) on the arms and contamination tests, what the agent is told and the plain-label
  wording, step and scale, the model, the budget cap and cache storage, the comparison, and whether the spec gains a
  version 3 section were decided by the owner on 2026-11-06, each as recommended. §11 steps 1–6 built 2026-11-06
  under `experiments/llm_agents/`, tested offline (`tests/experiments/llm_agents/`, LX.1–LX.20), reviewed, and the
  A0 baseline run (`docs/llm_agent_experiment_report.md`); no live call has been made. Open: the owner's review of
  the plain-label and prompt wording (`experiments/llm_agents/config/act_labels.md`, `prompt_text.md`, Q2), then
  step 7 (smoke LX.L1, pilot LX.L2, main, cross-check), each live phase on the owner's go-ahead.
