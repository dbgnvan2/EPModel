"""Golden run fingerprints for behaviour-preserving engine changes (Phase D plan B1).

Purpose: a refactor that is meant to change nothing (the store's windowed indexes) must leave a seeded run's
         whole log byte-identical. Each fingerprint is the SHA-256 of the run's records' repr.
Spec:    docs/implementation_plan_phase_d.md B1; docs/bowen_agent_model_spec_v2.md#M3.D.4a (seeded draws)
Tests:   this file

**Updating a fingerprint is a decision, not a fix.** Change one only in the commit of an engine change meant to
alter behaviour (plan B4 onward), and say in that commit which change moved it. Fingerprints taken 2026-10-10 at
the engine of commit 713458a (spec revision 14, before B1).
